# System Design: Recommendation System

## Problem Statement

Design a large-scale recommendation system that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences, viewing/listening history, or interactions. The system should handle real-time recommendations for millions of users and provide relevant content with high accuracy.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
1. **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and have their preferences and behaviors stored.
2. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide real-time, personalized recommendations for each user based on their preferences, interactions, and history.
3. **Content Catalog**: Maintain a catalog of items (movies, products, songs, etc.) to recommend to users.
4. **User Interactions**: Track user interactions with items (likes, ratings, purchases, views).
5. **Search**: Allow users to search for items and incorporate search history into recommendation generation.
6. **Trending Content**: Identify trending or popular items across the user base and incorporate these into recommendations.
7. **Feedback Loop**: Use user feedback (ratings, likes, views) to improve recommendations over time.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Scalability**: The system should be able to support millions of users and process billions of recommendations.
2. **Accuracy**: The recommendations should be relevant and personalized to each user.
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Recommendations should be generated and updated in real time as user interactions occur.
4. **Low Latency**: Deliver recommendations with minimal delay, even during high-traffic periods.
5. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user data and preferences are stored securely and used appropriately.

## Components of the System

The recommendation system can be broken down into the following key components:

1. **User Service**: Manages user registration, login, and stores user preferences and history.
2. **Content Catalog Service**: Stores the catalog of items (movies, products, etc.) to recommend.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Generates personalized recommendations for users using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Continuously updates the recommendation engine based on user feedback and interactions.
5. **Search and Browse Service**: Allows users to search for items, influencing future recommendations.
6. **Trending Content Service**: Identifies trending or popular items and integrates them into recommendations.
7. **Notification Service**: Sends personalized recommendations or updates to users based on their preferences and interactions.
8. **Analytics Service**: Tracks user behavior, engagement, and the performance of the recommendation algorithms.

## Types of Recommendation Algorithms

### 1. **Collaborative Filtering**
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items to a user based on the preferences of similar users (users who liked the same items).
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items that are similar to items the user has previously interacted with.

**Pros**: Works well with little content information. Highly scalable.

**Cons**: Struggles with the “cold start” problem, where new users or items have little interaction history.

### 2. **Content-Based Filtering**
- Recommends items based on the features of the items themselves and the user’s past behavior.
- For example, if a user likes a particular movie genre, the system will recommend similar movies.

**Pros**: Solves the cold start problem for new items and doesn’t rely on other users’ data.

**Cons**: Can be limited by the user’s history and doesn’t introduce novel or diverse recommendations.

### 3. **Hybrid Approach**
- Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve accuracy.
- For example, the system might use collaborative filtering for recommending items from other users and content-based filtering to refine those recommendations based on the user’s specific tastes.

**Pros**: Solves many of the drawbacks of both collaborative and content-based filtering.

## High-Level Design

1. **User Interface (UI)**: Users interact with the platform by searching for items, rating content, and consuming recommendations.
2. **API Layer**: Provides APIs for recommendation retrieval (`GET /recommendations`), tracking interactions (`POST /interactions`), and user login (`POST /login`).
3. **Service Layer**:
    - **User Service**: Handles user profiles, preferences, and past interactions (e.g., ratings, watch history).
    - **Catalog Service**: Manages the catalog of items to be recommended (e.g., products, movies).
    - **Recommendation Engine**: Applies recommendation algorithms to generate personalized recommendations for users.
    - **Feedback Loop**: Continuously refines recommendations based on user feedback and interactions.
    - **Search and Trending Service**: Incorporates search history and trending items into the recommendation process.
4. **Storage Layer**:
    - **Database**: Stores user profiles, interactions, and content catalog data.
    - **Cache**: Stores frequently accessed data such as personalized recommendations and popular content for low-latency access.
    - **Data Warehouse**: Stores user interaction data for running large-scale analytics and training machine learning models.

## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Registration and Preferences**

Users register using email, phone, or third-party OAuth (Google, Facebook). User preferences and behaviors (likes, ratings) are stored in the database.

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `username`     | String        | User’s username.                        |
| `email`        | String        | User’s email address.                   |
| `preferences`  | JSON          | User’s preferences (genre, category, etc.).|
| `interactions` | Array[JSON]   | List of user interactions (likes, views).|

---

### 2. **Content Catalog Management**

The content catalog stores metadata about all items (e.g., movies, products, songs) that can be recommended.

#### Database Schema for Content Catalog:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `item_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the item.         |
| `title`        | String        | Title of the item (movie, product, etc.).|
| `category`     | String        | Category or genre (e.g., Action, Romance).|
| `metadata`     | JSON          | Additional information (e.g., director, actors for movies).|
| `rating`       | Float         | Average rating of the item.             |
| `popularity`   | Float         | Popularity score based on views, ratings.|

---

### 3. **Recommendation Engine**

The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods to generate personalized recommendations.

#### Recommendation Generation Process:
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Finds users with similar behaviors and recommends items they liked.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those the user has previously liked or interacted with.
3. **Hybrid**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to generate recommendations.

#### Recommendation Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user receiving the recommendations.|
| `recommended_items` | Array[String] | List of recommended item IDs.        |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the recommendations were generated.|

---

### 4. **Feedback Loop**

The recommendation system learns from user interactions (likes, ratings, views) to improve future recommendations.

#### Interaction Tracking Flow:
1. **User Interacts**: User likes, views, or rates an item.
2. **Store Interaction**: The interaction is stored in the user’s profile.
3. **Update Recommendations**: The recommendation engine updates future recommendations based on the interaction.

#### Interaction Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `interaction_id`| String (PK)  | Unique identifier for the interaction.  |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user.                         |
| `item_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the item the user interacted with.|

| `rating`       | Float         | User rating (if applicable).            |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time of the interaction.                |

---

### 5. **Trending and Popular Items**

The system tracks global or regional trends and includes trending or popular items in recommendations.

#### Trending Flow:
1. The system tracks the number of interactions for each item (views, likes, shares).
2. Popular items are identified and included in the trending list.
3. The recommendation engine can factor in trending items as part of recommendations.

---

### 6. **Search and Explore**

Users can search for items, and their search behavior can be used to refine future recommendations.

#### Search Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `search_id`    | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the search query. |
| `query`        | String        | User search query (e.g., movie title, genre).|
| `results`      | Array[String] | List of item IDs matching the query.    |

---

### 7. **Notifications and Recommendations**

The system sends push notifications or in-app notifications to users, recommending new items or informing them of trends.

---

## Key Challenges

### 1. **Scalability**
- The system must handle millions of users and billions of recommendations.
    - **Solution**: Use horizontal scaling for the recommendation engine and content catalog services.

### 2. **Cold Start Problem**
- New users or items lack sufficient interaction history for personalized recommendations.
    - **Solution**: Use content-based filtering or trending content for new users/items, and gradually shift to collaborative filtering.

### 3. **Real-Time Recommendations**
- Users expect real-time updates to their recommendations after interactions.
    - **Solution**: Use asynchronous message queues (e.g., Kafka) to update recommendations in real time.

---

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### 1. **Real-Time Personalization**
- Use real-time user behavior to update recommendations instantly as users browse content.

### 2. **A/B Testing for Algorithms**
- Implement A/B testing to experiment with different recommendation algorithms and identify the best-performing approach.

### 3. **Explainable Recommendations**
- Provide transparency on why certain recommendations are being made, giving users insights into their viewing history or preferences.

---

## Data Flow

### 1. **Generating Recommendations**
- The user logs in, and the recommendation engine fetches user preferences and interactions.
- The engine retrieves similar users or items and generates a list of personalized recommendations.
- The recommendations are cached and displayed to the user.

### 2. **Tracking Interactions**
- The user interacts with an item (like, view, or rating).
- The interaction is stored in the database, and the recommendation engine updates the user's profile to improve future recommendations.

---

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Horizontal Scaling**
- Scale the recommendation engine and catalog service horizontally to handle millions of users and large datasets.

### 2. **Database Sharding**
- Shard user profiles and interaction data across multiple databases to distribute the load.

### 3. **Message Queues**
- Use message queues like **Kafka** to handle asynchronous updates to recommendations in real time.

### 4. **Caching**
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data like personalized recommendations and popular content.
