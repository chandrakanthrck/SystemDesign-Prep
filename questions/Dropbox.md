## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Authentication and Authorization**

Users must authenticate to upload, download, and manage files. OAuth 2.0 or similar protocols can be used for authentication.

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `username`     | String        | Username chosen by the user.            |
| `email`        | String        | Userâ€™s email address.                   |
| `password_hash`| String        | Hashed password for secure login.       |
| `quota`        | Float         | Maximum storage space allocated to the user. |

#### Key Operations:
- **Registration/Login**: Users can sign up, log in, or use OAuth for authentication.
- **Quota Management**: Track how much storage each user has used and enforce storage limits.

---

### 2. **File Upload, Download, and Storage**

Users can upload and download files. File uploads are handled by the **File Service**, which stores the file in distributed storage and tracks the metadata.

#### File Upload Flow:
1. User selects a file to upload via the UI.
2. The file is chunked (if large), and each chunk is uploaded to the storage service (e.g., S3).
3. The file metadata (name, size, type, upload time) is stored in the metadata database.
4. The system updates the user's file storage quota.

#### File Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `file_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the file.         |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user who uploaded the file.   |
| `file_name`    | String        | Name of the file.                       |
| `file_size`    | Float         | Size of the file in bytes.              |
| `file_type`    | String        | MIME type of the file (e.g., image/jpeg).|
| `file_path`    | String        | Path to the file in blob storage.       |
| `upload_time`  | Timestamp     | Time when the file was uploaded.        |
| `version`      | Integer       | Version of the file.                    |

---

### 3. **File Synchronization Across Devices**

Files should automatically sync across devices. The synchronization service tracks changes to files and syncs those changes in near real time across multiple devices.

#### Sync Flow:
1. A change (e.g., upload, delete, rename) is detected on one device.
2. The change is pushed to the synchronization service.
3. The service updates all other devices associated with the user, ensuring that changes are reflected across all devices.

#### Sync Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `sync_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the sync operation.|
| `file_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the file being synced.            |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user syncing the file.        |
| `device_id`    | String        | ID of the device where the change was made.|
| `operation`    | String        | Type of operation (upload, rename, delete).|
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the change was made.          |

---

### 4. **File Versioning**

When a file is updated or replaced, the previous version is stored so users can access or restore previous versions.

#### Versioning Flow:
1. A user uploads a new version of a file.
2. The system creates a new file version and stores the previous version in the versioning system.
3. Users can view or restore previous versions of the file.

#### Versioning Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `version_id`   | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the file version. |
| `file_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the file.                         |
| `version_number`| Integer      | Version number of the file.             |
| `file_path`    | String        | Path to the file version in blob storage.|
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the version was created.      |

---

### 5. **File Sharing and Collaboration**

Users can share files with others, either by generating a shareable link or giving specific users access. Permissions can be set for viewing, editing, or commenting.

#### Sharing and Collaboration Flow:
1. User selects a file to share and generates a link or assigns specific user permissions (view/edit).
2. The system creates a shareable link or updates the file permissions in the database.
3. Other users can access the file based on the permissions set by the owner.

#### Sharing Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `share_id`     | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the share.        |
| `file_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the file being shared.            |
| `shared_with`  | String        | Email or user ID of the recipient.      |
| `permission`   | String        | Permission level (view/edit).           |
| `share_link`   | String        | Shareable link (if public).             |
| `expiration`   | Timestamp     | Expiration time for the share link.     |

---

### 6. **Notifications**

Users receive notifications when files are updated, shared, or synchronized across devices.

#### Notification Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `notification_id`| String (PK) | Unique identifier for the notification. |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user receiving the notification.|
| `message`      | String        | Notification message.                   |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the notification was generated.|

### 3. **Multi-Tenant Support**
- Support for multiple organizations or clients, with isolated data storage for each tenant.

### 4. **Data Compression**
- Compress files before storing them to save storage space and reduce network bandwidth usage.

### 5. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Enhance security by requiring users to authenticate using 2FA in addition to their password.

---

## Data Flow

### 1. **File Upload**
- User selects a file and uploads it.
- The file is chunked and uploaded to blob storage.
- Metadata is stored in the database, and the user's quota is updated.

### 2. **File Synchronization**
- A user uploads a file or updates a file.
- The synchronization service tracks the changes and pushes them to other devices associated with the user.

### 3. **File Download**
- User requests to download a file.
- The file is retrieved from blob storage, and the user downloads it to their device.

---

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Blob Storage**
- Use distributed storage systems like AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage to store files. These systems handle replication, durability, and scalability out of the box.

### 2. **Sharding and Partitioning**
- Shard the metadata database to handle millions of users and billions of files. Sharding can be based on user IDs or file IDs.

### 3. **Load Balancing**
- Implement load balancers to distribute incoming requests (file uploads/downloads, sync requests) across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

### 4. **CDN for File Delivery**
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache and deliver frequently accessed files with low latency, especially for users in different geographical regions.
