## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**

Users can sign up using email, phone number, or social media OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook). After registration, they can log in and update their profile.

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `username`     | String        | Unique username chosen by the user.     |
| `email`        | String        | User’s email address.                   |
| `password_hash`| String        | Hashed password for secure login.       |
| `bio`          | String        | User's bio or description.              |
| `followers`    | Integer       | Number of followers the user has.       |
| `following`    | Integer       | Number of users the user is following.  |

#### Key Operations:
- **Registration/Login**: Users can register and log in via email/phone.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow or unfollow other users.

### 2. **Posting Tweets**

A user can post short text messages (up to 280 characters) and optionally attach media (images, videos).

#### Tweet Posting Flow:
1. The user creates a tweet.
2. If media is attached, it is uploaded to blob storage, and a URL is returned.
3. The tweet is stored in the database, along with any media URLs.
4. Followers of the user will see the tweet in their timeline.

#### Database Schema for Tweets:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `tweet_id`     | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the tweet.        |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user who posted the tweet.    |
| `content`      | Text          | Text content of the tweet.              |
| `media_url`    | String        | URL to any media attached to the tweet. |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time the tweet was posted.              |
| `likes`        | Integer       | Number of likes on the tweet.           |
| `retweets`     | Integer       | Number of retweets.                     |

---

### 3. **Timeline Generation**

The timeline is a personalized feed of tweets from users that the current user follows. It should be updated in real-time as new tweets are posted.

#### Timeline Generation Process:
1. When a user posts a tweet, the system identifies the followers of that user.
2. The tweet is inserted into the timelines of all followers.
3. When a user views their timeline, the system retrieves tweets from the users they follow, ordered by time or relevance.

#### Timeline Table (Cache):
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | ID of the user viewing the timeline.    |
| `timeline`     | Array[String] | List of tweet IDs for the user’s timeline.|
| `last_updated` | Timestamp     | Time when the timeline was last updated.|

---

### 4. **Likes and Retweets**

Users can like or retweet other users’ tweets, which will reflect on their timeline and be visible to their followers.

#### Likes Flow:
1. When a user likes a tweet, the `likes` count for the tweet is updated.
2. The user is notified that their tweet was liked.

#### Retweets Flow:
1. When a user retweets a tweet, a copy of the tweet is added to their timeline.
2. The retweeted tweet is also shared with their followers, and the original tweet’s `retweet` count is updated.

---

### 5. **Hashtags and Trends**

Users can add hashtags to their tweets to categorize them by topics. The system tracks popular hashtags to display trending topics.

#### Hashtag Usage:
1. When a tweet with a hashtag is posted, the hashtag is indexed in the search service.
2. The system tracks hashtag usage to identify trending topics based on the number of tweets with that hashtag.

#### Database Schema for Hashtags:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `hashtag`      | String (PK)   | The hashtag (e.g., `#sports`).          |
| `tweet_count`  | Integer       | Number of tweets using the hashtag.     |
| `last_used`    | Timestamp     | Last time the hashtag was used.         |

---

### 6. **Search Service**

The search service allows users to search for tweets, users, and hashtags. The system should return relevant results based on popularity, recency, or user preferences.

#### Search Flow:
1. The user searches for a term (e.g., `#music` or `JohnDoe`).
2. The system searches for relevant tweets, users, or hashtags.
3. Results are returned, ordered by relevance or recency.

#### Search Index:
- **Inverted Index**: Create an inverted index to map keywords to tweet IDs, usernames, and hashtags.
- **Trending Topics**: Periodically compute trending hashtags based on activity.

---

### 7. **Notifications**

Users should be notified when someone follows them, likes, or retweets their tweet. Notifications can be push notifications on mobile devices or in-app alerts.

#### Notification Flow:
1. When User A likes a tweet from User B, a notification is generated.
2. User B is notified of the like or retweet in real-time.

- The tweet is saved in the tweet service and indexed for search.
- Followers' timelines are updated with the new tweet.

### 2. **Timeline Retrieval**
- The user opens the app, and the system fetches their timeline.
- The timeline is either generated on-demand or fetched from a pre-generated timeline cache.

### 3. **Search for Hashtags**
- The user searches for a hashtag.
- The search service queries the inverted index for tweets with the specified hashtag.

---

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Sharding**
- Shard user data and tweet storage across multiple databases to handle millions of users and billions of tweets. Use user ID or tweet ID for partitioning.

### 2. **Caching**
- Use caching for frequently accessed timelines, popular tweets, and user profiles. **Redis** or **Memcached** can be used for this purpose.

### 3. **Load Balancing**
- Use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers, ensuring that the system handles a large volume of requests efficiently.

### 4. **Message Queues**
- Use message queues (e.g., Kafka) to handle high-throughput events like tweet posting, fan-out to followers' timelines, and notification events.
