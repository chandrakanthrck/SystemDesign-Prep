## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Profile Management**

Users can create and update profiles, including their name, age, location, interests, photos, and preferences for potential matches (e.g., age range, gender, distance).

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `name`         | String        | User’s name.                            |
| `age`          | Integer       | User’s age.                             |
| `gender`       | String        | User’s gender.                          |
| `location`     | String        | User’s location (latitude, longitude).  |
| `bio`          | Text          | Short biography or description.         |
| `photos`       | Blob          | Array of user photos.                   |
| `preferences`  | JSON          | Match preferences (age range, distance, etc.). |
| `last_active`  | Timestamp     | Last time the user was active.          |

#### Key Operations:
- **Create Profile**: Users input their basic information, preferences, and upload photos.
- **Update Profile**: Users can update their information (e.g., bio, interests).
- **Geolocation**: Users' location is tracked to enable location-based matching.

---

### 2. **Matching Algorithm**

The system suggests potential matches based on user preferences (e.g., location, age, gender). Each time a user swipes right (likes), the system checks if there’s a mutual like, leading to a match.

#### Matching Criteria:
1. **Location**: The system should match users within a specified radius (e.g., 10 miles).
2. **Preferences**: Match users based on preferences such as age range, gender, and interests.
3. **Activity**: Users who are recently active should be given higher priority in recommendations.

#### Matching Process:
1. User swipes right (like) on another user.
2. The system checks if the other user has also swiped right on them.
3. If mutual, a match is created, and both users are notified.

#### Matching Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `match_id`     | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the match.        |
| `user_id_1`    | String (FK)   | ID of the first user in the match.      |
| `user_id_2`    | String (FK)   | ID of the second user in the match.     |
| `status`       | String        | Match status (matched, unmatched).      |
| `match_time`   | Timestamp     | Time when the match occurred.           |

---

### 3. **Swipe System**

The swipe system is at the core of most dating apps, allowing users to either like or pass on potential matches. The system records each swipe and checks for mutual interest.

#### Swipe Process:
1. User swipes left (dislike) or right (like).
2. If the user swipes right, the system stores the interaction.
3. If both users swipe right, a match is created.

#### Swipe Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `swipe_id`     | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the swipe action. |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user performing the swipe.    |
| `target_user_id` | String (FK) | ID of the user being swiped on.         |
| `swipe_type`   | String        | Swipe type (like, dislike).             |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the swipe occurred.           |

---

### 4. **Chat System**

Once two users are matched, they can send messages to each other. The chat system should support real-time messaging using WebSockets.

#### Features of the Chat System:
1. **Real-Time Messaging**: Enable users to send and receive messages in real-time.
2. **Message History**: Users should be able to see their chat history with each match.
3. **Typing Indicators**: Show when the other user is typing.
4. **Read Receipts**: Indicate when messages are read.

#### Database Schema for Messages:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `message_id`   | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the message.      |
| `match_id`     | String (FK)   | ID of the match this message belongs to.|
| `sender_id`    | String (FK)   | ID of the user who sent the message.    |
| `content`      | Text          | The message content.                    |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the message was sent.         |
| `read_status`  | Boolean       | Whether the message has been read.      |

#### Chat Flow:
1. When a match is created, both users can start sending messages.
2. The system stores the messages in a NoSQL database like **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** to handle large-scale data storage.
3. Real-time messaging is enabled using **WebSockets** or **Socket.io**.

### 5. **Geolocation-Based Matching**

The system should match users based on their location and the proximity between them. The geolocation service tracks user location and suggests nearby users within a specific radius (e.g., 10 miles).

#### Geolocation Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `latitude`     | Float         | User’s latitude.                        |
| `longitude`    | Float         | User’s longitude.                       |
| `last_updated` | Timestamp     | Time when the location was last updated.|

#### Process:
1. Users' locations are updated in real-time or periodically based on their movements.
2. When searching for potential matches, the system filters users within the specified radius using geospatial queries.

---

### 6. **Notifications**

The notification system sends alerts to users when they have a new match or receive a new message.

#### Types of Notifications:
1. **Match Notifications**: Notifies users when they are matched with someone.
2. **Message Notifications**: Notifies users when they receive a new message.
3. **Push Notifications**: Send mobile push notifications to users even when the app is not active.

---

## Key Challenges

## Advanced Features (Optional)

### 1. **Super Like/Boost Features**
- Allow users to highlight their profile by using "super likes" or boosting their profile visibility.

### 2. **In-App Purchases**
- Implement monetization features such as in-app purchases for premium features like unlimited swipes, seeing who liked you, etc.

### 3. **Video Chat**
- Allow users to video chat within the app after a match is made, providing another layer of interaction before meeting in person.

### 4. **AI-Based Match Recommendations**
- Use machine learning to recommend matches based on past interactions, user behavior, and success rates of previous matches.

---

## Data Flow

### 1. **User Registration**
- User signs up using an email or phone number.
- The system creates a new user profile in the database.

### 2. **Swiping**
- User swipes left or right on other profiles.
- The system stores the swipe action and checks for mutual likes.
- If a match is found, both users are notified.

### 3. **Messaging**
- Once matched, users can start chatting.
- Messages are sent via WebSockets and stored in the message database for future retrieval.

---

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Database Sharding**
- Shard user profiles and match data across multiple databases to ensure the system can scale horizontally as the number of users grows.

### 2. **Caching**
- Use caching (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data, such as popular profiles, user preferences, and recent matches.

### 3. **Message Queuing**
- Use message queues (e.g., Kafka) to handle high-throughput events like match creation and message delivery.

### 4. **Load Balancing**
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across application servers to ensure the system handles large volumes of requests.
