# System Design: Cache System

## Problem Statement

Design a caching system that stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce latency and improve performance. The system should handle high read/write throughput, provide cache eviction strategies, and support horizontal scaling. The cache can be used as a layer between applications and databases to speed up data retrieval.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Cache Read/Write**: Store key-value pairs in memory for fast retrieval.
2. **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Support expiry times for cached items (e.g., keys should expire after a certain time).
3. **Cache Eviction**: Implement cache eviction policies such as LRU (Least Recently Used), LFU (Least Frequently Used), FIFO (First-In, First-Out) to manage memory usage.
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Provide mechanisms to invalidate (remove) stale or old cache entries when the underlying data changes.
5. **Persistence (Optional)**: Optionally, allow the cache to persist data to disk to survive restarts.
6. **Sharding**: Support sharding of data across multiple cache nodes to handle large data sets and high traffic.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Low Latency**: Data retrieval from the cache should be extremely fast (sub-millisecond access times).
2. **Scalability**: The system should scale horizontally to handle high throughput and large data volumes.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure that data is replicated across nodes to prevent data loss in case of cache server failure.
4. **Consistency**: Ensure cache consistency when multiple clients are accessing/updating the cache.

## Components of the System

1. **Cache Client**: The application or service that interacts with the cache to perform read/write operations.
2. **Cache Server**: Stores key-value pairs in memory and supports eviction, TTL, and read/write operations.
3. **Eviction Manager**: Manages cache eviction policies such as LRU, LFU, or FIFO to decide which keys should be removed when the cache is full.
4. **Replication Manager (Optional)**: Manages replication of cached data across multiple cache nodes to ensure fault tolerance.
5. **Sharding Manager**: Distributes the cache across multiple nodes to handle large datasets and traffic.

## High-Level Design

### 1. **Cache Server**:
- **In-Memory Storage**: Stores key-value pairs in memory (e.g., using a hash table for O(1) access time).
- **TTL Support**: Items can be configured with a time-to-live (TTL), after which they expire and are evicted from the cache.
- **Eviction Policies**: When the cache reaches capacity, items are evicted based on the configured eviction policy (LRU, LFU, FIFO).
- **Persistence (Optional)**: Some cache systems (like Redis) support persisting the cache to disk to survive restarts.

### 2. **Cache Client**:
- Applications interact with the cache through a client library, which abstracts away the details of how data is stored and retrieved.
- The client can read from the cache or write to the cache when data is updated.

### 3. **Eviction Manager**:
- Implements cache eviction policies to ensure that the cache does not exceed its memory limit.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Evicts the least recently accessed items when the cache is full.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evicts items that are accessed the least number of times.
- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**: Evicts items in the order they were added to the cache.

### 4. **Replication Manager (Optional)**:
- Replicates cached data across multiple cache servers to ensure fault tolerance.
- If one cache server fails, another replica can serve the cached data.

### 5. **Sharding Manager**:
- Distributes the cache across multiple servers based on key hashing or consistent hashing.
- Each cache server holds a subset of the overall data.

## Data Flow

### 1. **Cache Write**:
- A write request is sent to the cache from the client.
- The cache stores the key-value pair in memory.
- If the key has a TTL, it is set at the time of writing.
- The eviction manager ensures that the cache doesn’t exceed its memory limit by evicting items when necessary.

### 2. **Cache Read**:
- A read request is sent to the cache from the client.
- If the key exists in the cache, the value is returned.
- If the key does not exist (cache miss), the client fetches the data from the original data source (e.g., a database), writes it to the cache, and returns it.

### 3. **Cache Eviction**:
- When the cache reaches its memory limit, the eviction manager removes entries based on the chosen eviction policy (LRU, LFU, FIFO).
- Expired items are also automatically removed by the cache based on their TTL.

### 4. **Cache Invalidation**:
- When the underlying data changes (e.g., a database update), the corresponding cache entry must be invalidated (removed) to ensure consistency.
- This can be done through cache invalidation messages or automatic detection by the cache system.

## Key Challenges

### 1. **Consistency**:
- **Problem**: Cache consistency can be an issue when multiple clients are reading and writing to the cache simultaneously.
- **Solution**: Use cache invalidation or read-through/write-through caching techniques to keep the cache in sync with the underlying data.

### 2. **Cache Eviction**:
- **Problem**: When the cache reaches its memory limit, it must evict items. Choosing the right eviction policy can affect cache performance.
- **Solution**: Use policies like LRU (for general-purpose caching) or LFU (for high read-to-write ratio workloads).

### 3. **Scalability**:
- **Problem**: As traffic and data volumes increase, the cache must scale horizontally to handle the load.
- **Solution**: Use sharding to distribute the cache across multiple nodes and replicate data for fault tolerance.

### 4. **Fault Tolerance**:
- **Problem**: If a cache server fails, the data stored on that server is lost.
- **Solution**: Use replication to store copies of cached data across multiple servers to ensure that data is still available in the event of a failure.

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
- Add more cache nodes to scale the system horizontally. Sharding ensures that each node stores a portion of the total data.
- Load balancing is used to distribute requests evenly across all cache nodes.

### 2. **Replication**:
- Use replication to ensure that cache data is available even if one or more cache nodes fail. Each key can be replicated across multiple nodes.

### 3. **Consistent Hashing**:
- Use consistent hashing to distribute keys across cache nodes. Consistent hashing ensures minimal rehashing when new cache nodes are added or removed.

### 4. **Partitioning**:
- Partition the cache into smaller segments and assign each segment to a specific node. This reduces the load on any single node and allows the system to handle more data.

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Write-Through and Read-Through Caching**:
- **Write-Through Caching**: Data is written to both the cache and the underlying data store simultaneously. This ensures consistency between the cache and the data store.
- **Read-Through Caching**: If a key is not found in the cache, the system fetches it from the underlying data store, stores it in the cache, and returns the result to the client.

### 2. **Cache Warming**:
- Pre-populate the cache with data that is expected to be frequently accessed, reducing cache misses when the system first starts.

### 3. **Cache Monitoring**:
- Monitor cache performance and usage through metrics like hit rate, miss rate, eviction rate, and memory usage.
- Use monitoring tools like Prometheus to collect and visualize cache metrics.

### 4. **Multilevel Cache**:
- Implement a multilevel cache, where Level 1 (L1) cache is in-memory (e.g., Redis), and Level 2 (L2) cache is on disk. This helps store larger data sets that can’t fit in memory.

## Conclusion

A well-designed caching system is essential for improving performance and reducing latency in data-intensive applications. By using appropriate eviction policies, sharding, and replication, the system can scale to handle large datasets and high traffic loads while ensuring low-latency access to frequently used data.
