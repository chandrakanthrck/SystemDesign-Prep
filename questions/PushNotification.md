# System Design: Push Notification System

## Problem Statement

Design a scalable push notification system that can send notifications to millions of users in real-time across different platforms like iOS, Android, and web. The system should handle retries, prioritization, and guarantee delivery.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Send Notifications**: Ability to send notifications to users across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web).
2. **Targeted Notifications**: Notifications can be sent to individual users or groups of users.
3. **Notification Queueing**: Notifications should be queued and delivered asynchronously.
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retry failed notifications (e.g., if a device is offline).
5. **Scheduling**: Notifications should be scheduled for future delivery.
6. **Delivery Confirmation**: Track if the notification has been successfully delivered.
7. **Platform-Specific Payload**: Support platform-specific payload structures for iOS (APNS), Android (FCM), and Web (Push API).

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Scalability**: The system should handle millions of users and notifications.
2. **Low Latency**: Notifications should be delivered in real-time or near real-time.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure no notifications are lost during system failures.
4. **Reliability**: Ensure delivery through retries and acknowledgments.
5. **Security**: Ensure notifications are securely sent to the correct device using encryption and authentication.

## Components of the System

1. **Notification Service**: The core service that handles receiving, processing, and sending notifications.
2. **Message Queue**: A queue that holds notifications for processing. This helps in decoupling the senders and receivers, allowing the system to scale.
3. **Push Gateway (APNS/FCM/Web Push API)**: Acts as the bridge between the notification service and the platform-specific push services like APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), or Web Push API.
4. **Retry and Failure Handling**: Manages retrying notifications if the device is offline or the push gateway fails.
5. **Notification Scheduler**: Schedules notifications for future delivery.
6. **Notification Database**: Stores information about notifications, such as user preferences, delivery status, and logs.

## High-Level Design

### 1. **Notification Service**:
- **API Gateway**: External services can send notifications via an API.
- **Platform-Specific Handling**: Notifications are structured according to platform requirements (APNS for iOS, FCM for Android, Web Push for browsers).
- **Message Routing**: The service routes the notifications to the appropriate push gateway based on the user's platform.

### 2. **Message Queue**:
- **Queueing Notifications**: Notifications are placed in a queue when they are ready to be processed.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: The system processes notifications asynchronously, allowing for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Message Prioritization**: Higher priority notifications (e.g., critical system alerts) are sent before low-priority messages.

### 3. **Push Gateway**:
- **APNS**: Push gateway for Apple devices.
- **FCM**: Push gateway for Android devices.
- **Web Push**: Push gateway for browser notifications.
- Each gateway has different protocols and payload requirements, which the system must adhere to.

### 4. **Retry and Failure Handling**:
- **Retry Mechanism**: If a notification fails due to a transient issue (e.g., the device is offline), the system retries sending the notification at a later time.
- **Exponential Backoff**: For retries, use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the gateways.
- **Failure Logging**: If a notification repeatedly fails, log the failure and notify the sender (e.g., via an alert or email).

### 5. **Notification Scheduler**:
- **Scheduling API**: Allows notifications to be scheduled for a future time (e.g., send at 9 AM).
- **Delayed Processing**: Notifications are delayed in the message queue until their scheduled time for delivery.

### 6. **Notification Database**:
- **User Preferences**: Store user notification preferences (e.g., preferred notification types or time to receive notifications).
- **Delivery Logs**: Track the status of each notification (pending, sent, delivered, failed).
- **Auditing**: Log all notifications for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Data Flow

### 1. **Notification Creation**:
- An external service or user sends a notification request through an API to the Notification Service.
- The Notification Service validates and prepares the notification payload based on the target platform.

### 2. **Queueing**:
- The notification is placed into a message queue for processing.
- Notifications may be prioritized or scheduled for future delivery.

### 3. **Notification Processing**:
- The Notification Service dequeues the notification and routes it to the appropriate Push Gateway (APNS, FCM, Web Push).
- The Push Gateway handles delivering the notification to the userâ€™s device.

### 4. **Delivery Confirmation**:
- The Push Gateway sends a confirmation (acknowledgment) back to the Notification Service indicating whether the notification was successfully delivered or not.
- If unsuccessful, the notification is retried using a backoff strategy.

## Key Challenges

### 1. **Scalability**:
- Millions of notifications need to be processed in near real-time.
- **Solution**: Use message queues to decouple the processing and ensure that the system can scale horizontally.

### 2. **Platform-Specific Payloads**:
- Different platforms (APNS, FCM, Web Push) have different payload structures and protocols.
- **Solution**: Build platform-specific handlers that generate the appropriate payloads and communicate with the corresponding gateways.

### 3. **Retry Handling**:
- Notifications may fail if the device is offline or if the push service is down.
- **Solution**: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and failure logging.

### 4. **Delivery Guarantees**:
- Ensure that notifications are reliably delivered even in case of failures.
- **Solution**: Use acknowledgments from push gateways and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable delivery.

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
- Scale the Notification Service horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer.
- Message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) can be partitioned to allow parallel processing of notifications.

### 2. **Sharding and Partitioning**:
- Shard the user base across multiple databases to reduce the load on a single database and distribute traffic.

### 3. **Caching**:
- Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user device tokens) in an in-memory store like Redis to reduce the load on the database.

### 4. **Load Balancing**:
- Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across instances of the Notification Service to prevent bottlenecks.

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Batch Notifications**:
- Allow sending batch notifications (e.g., promotional messages) to millions of users simultaneously.

### 2. **Analytics and Reporting**:
- Provide detailed analytics on notifications, such as open rates, click-through rates, and engagement metrics.

### 3. **Segmentation and Targeting**:
- Segment users based on attributes (e.g., location, activity) and send targeted notifications.

### 4. **Rate Limiting**:
- Implement rate limiting to prevent overloading external push services like APNS or FCM.

### 5. **Multi-Tenant Support**:
- Support multiple clients or organizations with isolated data and separate notification queues for each tenant.

## Conclusion

Designing a push notification system requires handling platform-specific payloads, ensuring reliable delivery, and scaling to handle millions of users. By leveraging message queues, retries, and horizontal scaling, the system can efficiently send notifications to users in real-time, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance.
