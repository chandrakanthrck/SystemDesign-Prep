### 2. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**

The data ingestion service collects real-time data from various sources, including system logs, user activity, external APIs, and IoT devices.

#### Data Ingestion Flow:
1. Data is collected from multiple sources (e.g., user activity logs, sales metrics, IoT sensors).
2. The data is ingested into the system through APIs or message brokers (e.g., Kafka).
3. The system processes the incoming data and stores it in a real-time data store (e.g., Redis) for quick access.

#### Data Ingestion Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `data_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the data.         |
| `source`       | String        | Source of the data (e.g., log, API, IoT).|
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the data was ingested.        |
| `metric_type`  | String        | Type of metric (e.g., user activity, sales).|
| `value`        | Float         | Value of the metric.                    |
