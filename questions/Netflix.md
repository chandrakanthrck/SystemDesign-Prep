## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**

Users can register using email, phone number, or third-party OAuth (e.g., Google, Facebook). After registration, users can log in and manage their profiles.

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `email`        | String        | User’s email address.                   |
| `password_hash`| String        | Hashed password for secure login.       |
| `subscription` | String        | Subscription type (basic, premium, etc.).|
| `profiles`     | JSON          | Profiles created under the account.     |
| `watchlist`    | Array[String] | List of content the user has saved to watch later. |

#### Key Operations:
- **Registration/Login**: Users can register and log in via email/phone.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and manage multiple profiles under one account.

### 2. **Catalog Management**

The catalog contains all available movies, TV shows, and video content. The system allows users to browse by category, genre, or trending content.

#### Content Metadata:
- **Movies**: Contains metadata such as title, genre, release year, director, cast, description, and content rating.
- **TV Shows**: Contains metadata such as title, season number, episode titles, duration, and descriptions.

#### Database Schema for Catalog:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `content_id`   | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the content.      |
| `title`        | String        | Title of the movie/TV show.             |
| `genre`        | String        | Genre of the content.                   |
| `type`         | String        | Type (movie or TV show).                |
| `rating`       | Float         | Average user rating for the content.    |
| `duration`     | Integer       | Duration of the content in minutes.     |
| `release_date` | Date          | Release date of the content.            |
| `cast`         | Array[String] | List of actors in the movie/TV show.    |
| `available_in` | Array[String] | Available regions for streaming.        |

### 3. **Recommendation Engine**

The recommendation engine analyzes user behavior, watch history, and preferences to generate personalized content recommendations.

#### Recommendation Algorithm:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends content based on similar user preferences and watch history.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends content similar to the user’s previous viewing habits (e.g., same genre, actors).
- **Trending Content**: Highlights popular or trending content in the user’s region.
- **Watch History**: Recommends content based on what the user has previously watched and rated.

---

### 4. **Video Streaming Service**

The video streaming service uses **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR)** to dynamically adjust the quality of the video based on the user’s internet connection.

#### Streaming Process:
1. **Content Encoding**: Each video is encoded in multiple formats and bitrates (e.g., 240p, 720p, 1080p, 4K).
2. **CDN Delivery**: Content is distributed through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to ensure low-latency streaming.
3. **Player Selection**: The client player dynamically adjusts the video quality based on the available bandwidth.

#### Video Format:
- **Video Codecs**: H.264, H.265 (HEVC), VP9, AV1.
- **Audio Codecs**: AAC, MP3, Opus.
- **Protocols**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP).

### 5. **Watchlist and History Service**

Users can save content to a watchlist for later viewing and track their viewing history.

#### Watchlist and History Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user.                         |
| `content_id`   | String (FK)   | ID of the content.                      |
| `status`       | String        | Status (watched, unwatched).            |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time when the content was added to the watchlist. |

---

### 6. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**

The CDN is responsible for delivering video content to users with low latency, no matter where they are in the world. It caches video content at geographically distributed locations.

#### Key CDN Features:
- **Edge Servers**: Caches video content at multiple locations worldwide, reducing the distance between users and the content.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple servers to ensure fast response times.
- **Geolocation-Based Routing**: Directs users to the nearest server for fast content delivery.

---

### 7. **Search Service**

The search service enables users to find specific content by title, actor, director, genre, or keyword.

#### Search Flow:
1. User enters a search query (e.g., "Inception").
2. The system queries the search index for matching content.
3. Results are ranked by relevance and returned to the user.

#### Search Index:
- Use a search engine like **Elasticsearch** to index and query content metadata (e.g., title, description, cast, genre).

---

### 8. **Analytics Service**

Tracks user activity (e.g., watch time, engagement) and monitors system performance.

#### Key Metrics:
1. **User Engagement**: Tracks what content users are watching, how long they watch, and user ratings.
2. **System Performance**: Monitors server load, video buffering events, and CDN performance.
3. **Content Popularity**: Tracks the popularity of content and trending shows/movies.
