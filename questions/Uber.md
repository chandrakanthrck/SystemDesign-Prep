## Detailed Design

### 1. **User Registration and Authentication**

Both passengers and drivers should be able to sign up using email, phone number, or third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook). The system should verify phone numbers and documents for drivers.

#### Database Schema for Users:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the user.         |
| `name`         | String        | User’s name.                            |
| `email`        | String        | User’s email address.                   |
| `phone_number` | String        | User’s phone number.                    |
| `role`         | String        | Role of the user (driver or passenger). |
| `driver_details` | JSON         | Driver-specific details (license, vehicle info). |

#### Key Operations:
- **Registration/Login**: Users can register and log in via email/phone or third-party services.
- **Profile Verification (Drivers)**: Drivers must verify documents (driver’s license, vehicle registration) before they can accept rides.

---

### 2. **Real-Time Matching**

The system should find nearby drivers for passengers based on their location and preferences. It should consider factors like the number of available drivers, surge pricing, and traffic conditions.

#### Matching Process:
1. Passenger requests a ride by providing their pickup location.
2. The system retrieves a list of available drivers near the passenger’s location.
3. The ride request is sent to the nearest available driver, who can accept or decline the ride.
4. If the driver declines, the request is sent to the next available driver.

#### Matching Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ride_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the ride request. |
| `passenger_id` | String (FK)   | ID of the passenger requesting the ride.|
| `driver_id`    | String (FK)   | ID of the driver accepting the ride.    |
| `pickup_location` | String     | Passenger’s pickup location (latitude, longitude). |
| `status`       | String        | Status of the ride request (pending, accepted, completed). |

---

### 3. **Trip Management**

Once a ride is accepted, the trip management service handles the trip lifecycle, including pickup, tracking the ride, and drop-off. This service ensures that the trip is completed smoothly, with real-time updates to both driver and passenger.

#### Trip Flow:
1. Passenger requests a ride.
2. Driver accepts the request.
3. The trip is initiated, and both parties can see each other’s real-time location.
4. Upon reaching the destination, the driver marks the trip as completed, and fare calculation is triggered.

#### Trip Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `trip_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the trip.         |
| `driver_id`    | String (FK)   | ID of the driver handling the trip.     |
| `passenger_id` | String (FK)   | ID of the passenger.                    |
| `pickup_location` | String     | Starting location of the trip.          |
| `dropoff_location` | String    | Final location of the trip.             |
| `distance`     | Float         | Distance covered during the trip.       |
| `fare`         | Float         | Fare for the trip.                      |
| `status`       | String        | Status of the trip (ongoing, completed).|

### 4. **Geolocation and Tracking**

The system should continuously track the real-time location of both drivers and passengers using GPS. Locations should be updated frequently and displayed on a map.

#### Geolocation Process:
1. Drivers send location updates every few seconds.
2. Passengers can see the real-time location of their assigned driver.
3. During the trip, both the driver and passenger’s locations are tracked and updated.

#### Geolocation Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the driver or passenger.          |
| `latitude`     | Float         | Current latitude of the user.           |
| `longitude`    | Float         | Current longitude of the user.          |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp     | Time of the location update.            |

#### Fare Calculation Formula:
- **Base Fare**: Fixed starting fare for the ride.
- **Distance Fare**: Cost per kilometer or mile traveled.
- **Time Fare**: Cost per minute for time spent in the trip.
- **Surge Pricing**: Multiplier applied during high demand to increase the fare.

#### Pricing Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `fare_id`      | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the fare calculation. |
| `trip_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the trip.                         |
| `base_fare`    | Float         | The starting fare for the trip.         |
| `distance_fare`| Float         | Fare based on the distance traveled.    |
| `time_fare`    | Float         | Fare based on the time spent.           |
| `surge_multiplier` | Float     | Surge multiplier applied to the fare.   |
| `total_fare`   | Float         | Total fare for the trip.                |

### 6. **Payment Processing**

The system should handle secure payments, including credit/debit card processing, digital wallets, and driver payouts.

#### Payment Flow:
1. After the trip is completed, the fare is calculated and displayed to the passenger.
2. The passenger’s payment method (credit card, digital wallet) is charged.
3. The driver receives the payout after deducting a service fee.

#### Payment Table:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `payment_id`   | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the payment.      |
| `trip_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the trip for which the payment was made. |
| `amount`       | Float         | Total fare amount.                      |
| `status`       | String        | Payment status (pending, completed).    |
| `payment_method`| String       | Payment method (credit card, digital wallet). |

### 7. **Rating and Reviews**

After the ride, passengers and drivers should be able to rate and review each other. This helps improve the service and maintain quality.

#### Rating and Review Schema:
| Field          | Type          | Description                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `rating_id`    | String (PK)   | Unique identifier for the rating.       |
| `trip_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the trip associated with the rating. |
| `user_id`      | String (FK)   | ID of the user leaving the review.      |
| `rating`       | Integer       | Rating given (1-5 stars).               |
| `review`       | Text          | Optional review comment.                |
