# System Design: Task Scheduler

## Problem Statement

Design a task scheduling system that can schedule, execute, and monitor various tasks at specified times. The system should handle distributed tasks, retries on failure, and task prioritization. Tasks can range from simple scheduled jobs (e.g., backups) to more complex workflows that involve multiple steps.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. **Task Scheduling**: Users can schedule tasks to run at a specific time (e.g., daily, weekly).
2. **Task Execution**: The system should execute tasks at the specified time and allow for both one-time and recurring tasks.
3. **Distributed Task Execution**: The system should distribute tasks across multiple worker nodes.
4. **Retry on Failure**: Tasks should automatically retry upon failure.
5. **Task Prioritization**: The system should support task prioritization, where high-priority tasks are executed first.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: The system should monitor tasks and log task execution status (success, failure, retry).
7. **Task Dependencies**: Allow for tasks to be executed in sequence or after other tasks have completed.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. **Scalability**: The system should scale to handle a large number of scheduled tasks and workers.
2. **Reliability**: The system must ensure that scheduled tasks are executed reliably, even in the face of failures.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: The system should be able to recover from worker failures or other issues without losing tasks.
4. **High Availability**: The system should be available 24/7 to handle tasks without interruption.
5. **Concurrency**: Tasks should be executed concurrently across different worker nodes to maximize efficiency.

## Components of the System

1. **Scheduler Service**: Responsible for scheduling tasks and triggering task execution at the right time.
2. **Task Queue**: A distributed queue where tasks are placed after being scheduled. Tasks are dequeued by workers when they are ready to be executed.
3. **Worker Nodes**: Workers are distributed systems responsible for fetching tasks from the queue and executing them.
4. **Task Execution Engine**: Responsible for running the actual logic of tasks, retrying failed tasks, and marking them as complete.
5. **Monitoring and Logging Service**: Tracks task status, logs the results of task execution, and provides notifications on task success or failure.
6. **Task Repository**: Stores task metadata, execution times, dependencies, priorities, and retry policies.

## High-Level Design

### 1. **Scheduler Service**:
- Receives task creation requests through an API.
- Allows users to specify task details such as time, recurrence, priority, and task payload.
- Handles task scheduling, which includes storing the task in a queue or database for future execution.
- Checks whether any dependencies need to be satisfied before a task is executed.

### 2. **Task Queue**:
- A distributed message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS) where tasks are placed.
- Tasks are ordered based on execution time and priority.
- Workers poll the queue for tasks that are ready for execution.

### 3. **Worker Nodes**:
- Distributed workers are responsible for dequeuing tasks and executing them.
- Workers can be dynamically added or removed to scale based on the number of tasks.
- Each worker node runs task logic and reports success, failure, or retries to the Scheduler Service.
- Use heartbeat checks to detect worker node failures and redistribute tasks.

### 4. **Task Execution Engine**:
- Executes the task’s logic once it is dequeued from the Task Queue.
- Handles retries if a task fails due to transient issues (e.g., network failures, system crashes).
- Tasks can be executed concurrently across different workers to increase throughput.
- Provides support for task dependencies, ensuring that dependent tasks are executed in order.

### 5. **Monitoring and Logging Service**:
- Logs each task’s start time, end time, success, or failure status.
- Provides a dashboard or API for administrators to monitor the health of tasks and worker nodes.
- Alerts and notifications can be generated if a task fails repeatedly or is delayed.
- Tracks task retry attempts and final outcomes.

### 6. **Task Repository**:
- Stores all metadata related to tasks (task ID, payload, schedule, priority, dependencies).
- Keeps track of when a task should be executed (e.g., once, daily, or weekly).
- Stores retry policies, task priority, and the number of times a task has been retried.

## Data Flow

### 1. **Task Scheduling**:
- The user submits a task through an API.
- The Scheduler Service validates the task and stores it in the Task Repository.
- The Scheduler Service then queues the task in the Task Queue when the time comes for it to be executed.

### 2. **Task Execution**:
- A Worker Node polls the Task Queue for tasks that are ready to be executed.
- The Worker fetches the task from the queue and executes it.
- The Worker reports the result (success, failure, or retry) back to the Scheduler Service.

### 3. **Retry Mechanism**:
- If a task fails, the Worker marks the task as failed and re-queues it for retry based on the retry policy.
- The Task Execution Engine retries the task with an exponential backoff strategy (wait longer between retries).

### 4. **Task Monitoring**:
- The Monitoring Service tracks each task’s status (pending, running, success, failure, retries).
- It logs execution data and provides alerts in case of task failures or prolonged delays.

## Key Challenges

### 1. **Scalability**:
- The system should handle thousands to millions of tasks being scheduled concurrently.
- **Solution**: Use distributed workers and message queues to allow horizontal scaling.

### 2. **Fault Tolerance**:
- If a worker node crashes or a task fails, the system should recover gracefully and ensure that the task is executed.
- **Solution**: Implement task retry policies, worker health checks, and automatic task reassignment in case of failures.

### 3. **Task Dependencies**:
- Some tasks depend on the completion of other tasks before they can be executed.
- **Solution**: The Scheduler should track task dependencies and ensure that tasks are executed in the correct order.

### 4. **Reliability**:
- The system must guarantee that tasks are executed at the scheduled time without being lost or forgotten.
- **Solution**: Use reliable message queues with persistent storage, and maintain detailed task logs for auditing.

## Scaling the System

### 1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
- Use distributed workers that can be scaled horizontally across multiple machines.
- Dynamically add or remove workers based on the current task load.

### 2. **Sharding the Task Queue**:
- Shard the Task Queue based on task type, priority, or time. This helps distribute the load and ensures that tasks are processed in parallel.

### 3. **Load Balancing**:
- Use load balancers to evenly distribute tasks across worker nodes. This prevents overloading any single worker.

### 4. **Distributed Task Repository**:
- The Task Repository can be stored in a distributed database like Cassandra or DynamoDB to handle high throughput and ensure data durability.

## Advanced Features

### 1. **Task Prioritization**:
- Assign different priority levels to tasks. High-priority tasks can jump ahead of low-priority tasks in the queue.

### 2. **Cron-Like Scheduling**:
- Support advanced scheduling options, such as cron jobs, where tasks can be scheduled at specific intervals or on certain days (e.g., every Monday at 9 AM).

### 3. **Task Segmentation**:
- Support different types of tasks, such as time-critical tasks, data processing jobs, or background jobs that can be run at lower priority.

### 4. **Workflow Orchestration**:
- Extend the system to handle complex workflows where tasks have multiple dependencies and require coordination across different services.

## Conclusion

A task scheduler system is crucial for managing scheduled and distributed tasks efficiently. By leveraging a distributed architecture, message queues, and retries, the system ensures tasks are executed reliably and at the right time. It also provides scalability by allowing tasks to be distributed across many worker nodes and ensures fault tolerance through retries and monitoring.
