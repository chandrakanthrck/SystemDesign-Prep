# System Design Preparation

This repository is a collection of system design concepts, real-world application designs, and interview questions to help you prepare for system design interviews. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource covering both theoretical concepts and practical system designs.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Concepts**: Covers the essential concepts needed to understand and design scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient systems.
2. **Questions**: Contains system design problems and their detailed solutions for real-world applications.
